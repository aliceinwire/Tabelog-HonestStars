Tabelog's score system is well known for [its points being distributed mostly between 3.1 and 3.5](http://tabelog.com/help/score/). The restaurants with over 4 stars (or even 3.5) can be regarded as exceptionally great, while those around 3.0 are not as good.

This Chrome extension changes the display of stars on Tabelog in *Honest Scale* in order to make it more accurate and intuitive, as follows:

* 4.0 or over => 5 stars
* 3.5 to 4.0 => 4.5 stars
* 3.4 to 3.5 => 4 stars
* 3.3 to 3.4 => 3.5 stars
* 3.1 to 3.3 => 3 stars
* 3.0 to 3.1 => 2 stars
* below 3.0  => 1 star
